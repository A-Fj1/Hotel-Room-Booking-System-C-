# Hotel Room Booking System (C++)

## Overview
This project is a console-based Hotel Room Booking System developed in C++.  
The system manages hotel rooms and customer bookings using arrays as the primary data structure.

The program allows users to add rooms, book rooms, display availability, and check booking status through a menu-driven interface.

---

## Objectives
- Practice array-based data storage.
- Implement a structured menu-driven program.
- Manage room and booking data using basic C++ concepts.
- Simulate a simple real-world hotel booking workflow.
